                <p>I adopted my cat Murphy when he was 5 years old. He still acts like a kitten, but also knows how to nap like nobody's business.
                    He follows my all over the house, and loves to yell at me. He loves to snuggle, especially in the mornings. 
                    <strong>Belly rubs are his favorite, they make him drool all over the place.</strong>
                </p>
